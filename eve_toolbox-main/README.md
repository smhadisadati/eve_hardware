Endovascular Environment: Modular Toolbox to quickly prototype new Endovascular Environments

This Repo is planned to be Open Source on request. It will not be publicily available, but upon request research institutes will be granted access.

This Repo allows to create modular endovascular environments with the following components:

* Vesseltree
* Device
* Simulation
* Start position of episode (within bounds)
* Target selection
* Pathfinder
* Observation
* Reward
* Terminal criterion
* Truncation criterion
* Imaging (Optional)
* Interim Targets (Optional)
* Visualization (Optional)

Have SOFA installed and SofaPythonPlugin configured!
